<h1>Welcome to project <b>key2key</b>..</h1>
<br>
Keybase[0] is failing to reach its true potential after being acquired[1]. 
<br>
Our goal is to continue the original vision to deliver capable cryptography in a user-friendly package.
<br>
<h2>What are we doing?</h2>
<br>
We are creating a federated fork of the keybase with strong privacy guarantees:
<br>
- Full e2e encryption<br>
- Metadata leak protection<br>
- High resiliency to attacks<br>
- Decentralized hierarchical model with no single points of failure<br>
<br>
<h2>How are we doing this?</h2>
<br>
Using the existing open source client[2], we are reverse engineering the server code to allow anyone to host an open source server.<br>
<br>
<h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>
<br>
- For ourselves: we are avid keybase users and we are preparing for the moment keybase centralized servers will be shut down<br>
- For the existing keybase community: keybase has built such an awesome community and we think it should be preserved<br>
- For the FOSS space as a whole: keybase is a useful tool that needs more development to reach its full potential<br>
