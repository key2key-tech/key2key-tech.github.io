# Welcome to project <b>key2key</b>..

Keybase[0] is failing to reach its true potential after being acquired[1]. 

Our goal is to continue the original vision to deliver capable cryptography in a user-friendly package.

## What are we doing?
We are creating a federated fork of the keybase with strong privacy guarantees:
- Full e2e encryption
- Metadata leak protection
- High resiliency to attacks
- Decentralized hierarchical model with no single points of failure

## How are we doing this?
Using the existing open source client[2], we are reverse engineering the server code to allow anyone to host an open source server.

## Why are we doing this?
- For ourselves: we are avid keybase users and we are preparing for the moment keybase centralized servers will be shut down
- For the existing keybase community: keybase has built such an awesome community and we think it should be preserved
- For the FOSS space as a whole: keybase is a useful tool that needs more development to reach its full potential
